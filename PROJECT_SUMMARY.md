- **Redis**: Caching and session storage

### 🛠️ Management Tools
✅ **Environment Management**
- `k3s-dev-env.sh`: Complete environment lifecycle management
- `show-services.sh`: Service status and URL overview
- `setup-hosts.sh`: Domain access configuration
- `setup-port-forwards.sh`: Port forwarding setup
- `test-ingress.sh`: Connectivity testing
- `health-check.sh`: Environment health verification

✅ **Access Configuration**
- Domain-based access via `.localhost` domains
- Alternative port forwarding for fallback access
- Automated hosts file configuration
- Connection helpers for databases

### 📚 Documentation Structure

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Namespace Organization
- **traefik-system**: Ingress controller and routing
- **development**: Application services and databases
- **cattle-system**: Rancher management platform
- **kube-system**: Kubernetes core components

### Data Persistence
- Kubernetes PersistentVolumes for all stateful services
- Automatic data retention across environment restarts
- Isolated storage for each service component

### Network Architecture
```
User → k3d LoadBalancer:80 → Traefik → Service Routing
                           ↓
                Host-based routing (.localhost domains)
                    ↓
            Individual service pods
```

## � Development Features

### ⚡ Quick Environment Control
```bash
./k3s-dev-env.sh start      # Start complete environment
./k3s-dev-env.sh stop       # Clean shutdown
./show-services.sh          # View status and URLs
```

### 🌐 Flexible Access Methods
- **Domain Access**: Clean URLs via `.localhost` domains
- **Port Forwarding**: Direct localhost port access
- **Database Connections**: Standard connection strings
- **API Access**: REST APIs for automation

### 📊 Built-in Monitoring
- Pre-configured Grafana dashboards for Kubernetes metrics
- Prometheus targets automatically discovered
- Jaeger tracing ready for microservices
- Rancher visual cluster management

### 💾 Storage Solutions
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- MinIO for object/file storage
- Persistent volumes for data retention

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### � Security Considerations
- Services isolated by namespace and RBAC
- Database services not exposed externally
- Default credentials documented (development only)
- Ingress controller handles all external access

### 📖 Documentation Standards
- Clear, concise instructions for all operations
- Multiple access methods documented
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Architecture diagrams and explanations

### 🧪 Testing and Validation
- Health check scripts for environment validation
- Connectivity testing tools included
