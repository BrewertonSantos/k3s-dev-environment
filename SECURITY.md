## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our K3s development environment seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

Please **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via:
- **Email**: [Insert security contact email]
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Security" tab in the repository to privately report vulnerabilities

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
5. **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce** the issue
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours**
- We will provide a detailed response within **7 days** indicating our evaluation of the report
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

## Security Considerations

### Container Security

- All container images are based on official upstream images
- Regular security updates are applied to base images
- Non-root users are used where possible
- Minimal attack surface with only necessary packages

### Kubernetes Security

- **RBAC**: Proper Role-Based Access Control is implemented
- **Network Policies**: Services are isolated using Kubernetes network policies
- **Secrets Management**: Sensitive data is stored in Kubernetes secrets
- **Security Contexts**: Containers run with appropriate security contexts
- **Pod Security Standards**: Enforced pod security standards

### Infrastructure Security

- **TLS/SSL**: All external communications use encryption
- **Authentication**: Default credentials should be changed immediately
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege is applied
- **Monitoring**: Security events are logged and monitored

### Development Environment Specific

⚠️ **Important**: This is a development environment and should **NOT** be used in production without proper security hardening:

- Default credentials are used for convenience
- Self-signed certificates may be present
- Debug modes may be enabled
- Security policies may be relaxed for development ease

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Change Default Credentials**: Immediately change all default passwords
2. **Network Isolation**: Run in isolated environments
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
4. **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring
5. **Backup**: Regularly backup your configurations and data

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after verification
- Documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- Announced in GitHub releases
- Tagged with security-related labels

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about this security policy, please contact us through the repository issues (for non-security questions) or via the security reporting channels mentioned above.
